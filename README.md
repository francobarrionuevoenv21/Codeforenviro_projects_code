About the project

This blog is a personal project that emerged  from my passion for data science and concern about various environmental problems. My objective is to share guides, code and analyses I made working with public access data, with the focus on gaining insights and provide solutions for climate or pollution issues.

The topics I am interested in and will be exploring on this blog include fire risk, flooding risk, water availability, and water quality monitoring.
