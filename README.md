About the project

This blog is a personal project that emergedÂ  from my passion for data science and concern about various environmental problems. My objective is to share guides, reusable code and analyses I made working with public access data, with the focus on climate change and pollution related issues.

The topics I am interested in and will be exploring on this blog include fire risk, flooding risk, water availability, and water quality monitoring.
